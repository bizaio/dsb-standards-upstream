# Introduction

These standards have been developed as part of the Australian Government's introduction of the [Consumer Data Right](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right "ACCC Consumer Data Right webpage") legislation to give Australians greater control over their data.

The Consumer Data Right (CDR) is intended to be applied sector by sector across the whole economy, beginning in the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors.  These standards have been developed to facilitate the Consumer Data Right by acting as a specific baseline for implementation.

CSIROâ€™s Data61 has been appointed as the Data Standards Body (DSB) for the CDR regime. These standards have been prepared by the DSB.  The work of the team is  overseen by the Data Standards Chair, Mr. Andrew Stevens, with industry and consumer advice provided by an Advisory Committee. The work of standards development is conducted in close consultation with the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0) as lead regulator of the Consumer Data Right, supported by the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/consumer-data-right/about-the-consumer-data-right/).

The standards are required to be published. The obligations on CDR participants to apply the published standards commence on the commencement of the Consumer Data Right rules:

- where the rules require compliance with the standards, non-compliance with the standards may constitute a breach of the rules.
- where the standards are specified as binding standards as required by the Consumer Data Right rules for the purposes of s56FA of the legislation, they apply as under contract between a data holder and an accredited data recipient.  The legal effect of binding standards as between data holders and accredited data recipients is fully set out in s56FD and s56FE of the legislation.

## Future Dated Obligations

The standards, as published from time to time, may include specific statements indicating that a specific section of the standards will not take effect until a future date or may cease to have effect on some future date.

The table below highlights these areas of the standards.
