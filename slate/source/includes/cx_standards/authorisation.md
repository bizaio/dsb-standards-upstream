## Authorisation Standards

|Area|CX Standard|
|-------------------|------------------------------|
|**Authorisation:**<br/> Account selection |Data holders **MUST** allow the consumer to select which of their accounts to share data from if the data request includes account-specific data and if there are multiple accounts available. The Data holder **MAY** omit this step if none of the data being requested is specific to an account (e.g. Saved Payees).|
|**Authorisation:**<br/>Profile selection |<p>Data holders **MAY** add a 'profile selection' step or equivalent prior to the account selection step if a single identifier provides access to different customer accounts. For example, one customer ID may give access to business customer and individual customer accounts.</p><p>The 'profile selection' step **SHOULD** only be considered if it is an existing customer experience, and **SHOULD** be as minimal as possible to avoid introducing unwarranted friction (having regard to CDR Rule 4.24).</p>|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>Displaying accounts|<p>If certain accounts are unavailable to share, data holders **SHOULD** show these unavailable accounts in the account-selection step. </p><p>Data holders **SHOULD** communicate why these accounts cannot be selected, and this **SHOULD** be communicated as in-line help or as a modal to reduce on-screen content.</p><p>Data holders **MAY** provide instructions on how to make these accounts available to share, and this **SHOULD** be communicated as in-line help or as a modal to reduce on-screen content.</p><p>*Note:* Unavailable accounts are to be interpreted in accordance with the rules on eligible consumers and required consumer data.</p>|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>No accounts can be shown|If unavailable accounts cannot be shown in the account selection step, data holders **MAY** display a generic explanation and instructions.|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>Authorisation not permitted|If a successfully authenticated user cannot proceed to establish an authorisation in accordance with the rules on eligible consumers and required consumer data, data holders **MAY** provide the option of concluding the authorisation process.|
|**Unavailable Accounts:**<br/>Request sharing rights|If a user does not have sharing rights for a particular account or set of accounts, data holders **MAY** invite the user to request sharing rights from the authorisation flow. The presentation of this mechanism **MUST NOT** introduce unwarranted friction as defined in rule 4.24 on restrictions.|
|**Authorisation:**<br>Account confirm|Data holders **MUST** show which accounts the data is being shared from prior to confirming authorisation if the data request includes account-specific data. The data holder **MAY** omit this information if none of the data being requested is specific to an account (e.g. Saved Payees).|
